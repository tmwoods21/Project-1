Tamagotchi Project-

Welcome to my tamagotchi game!
The objective is very simple:
  -Take care off your tamagochi's needs in order to win.
  -The needs that need to be met in order to win are either the food, sleepiness, or play. 
  -If any of the needs reaches 10 before your tamagotchi turns 10, then you will get a "game over".
  -If all of the needs are met until the tamagotchi reaches age 10, you win!
